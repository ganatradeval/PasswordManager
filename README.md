# Password Manager
This is Simple Password manager which asks for master password and let's you create and store passwords for other sites so that no need to remember so many passwords. After all we have so many other things to remember. 

My advice is to use this kind of sites but use your brain with you. So that no one has access to your accounts even after database is get hacked!
As example, use this password as a hint and do transformation and then resultant password can be your real password.

After all nothing is more SECURE than human brains....

# Password Manager
This is an idea more than any project for you to create strong passwords any make it easy to remember. Remember only a part which is easy and rest of put on this tool.

A Simple Password manager which asks for master password and let's you create and store passwords for other sites so that no need to remember so many passwords. After all we have so many other things to remember. 

## Use 
Let's say your password is combination of two: UniquePhrase + DefaultPhrase.

	UniquePhrase = Derives from this site
	DefaultPhrase = Needs to remember by you. (Which is easy as you can make it same for all accounts)

### Example
This site shows password for facebok.com : *127e74c==1e1f95*. Then I will derive **UniquePhrase** like *1e1f95*(ignore first part) and my **DefaultPhrase** can be like *Deval@124* (My name easy to remember)
Thus, my password for facebok.com is: 1e1f95Deval@124

## Explanation 
Rather than using password managers which stores your passwords, we can use this methods as we are never storing original password anywhere. So if database hack occurs than also only one part is revealed (and it's worthless).
In addtion, You have choice for selecting perticular string from given (stored) strings. Like you can select first half, later half or middle one. 
Your password can only be revealed if you say it to anyone.

If you wanted to use it just make hosting somewhere and then you can access it from anywhere.

After all nothing is more SECURE than human brains!....
