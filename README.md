Password Manager
# Password Manager
This is Simple Password manager which asks for master password and let's you create and store passwords for other sites so that no need to remember so many passwords. After all we have so many other things to remember. 

My advice is to use this kind of sites but use your brain with you. So that no one has access to your accounts even after database is get hacked!
As example, use this password as a hint and do transformation and then resultant password can be your real password.

After all nothing is more SECURE than human brains....
